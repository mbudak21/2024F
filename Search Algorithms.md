## Graph vs Tree search algorithms:
Graph: Ignore the node if expanded before.
Tree: Expand whatever you have.

## Algorithms
Without Heuristics (Uninformed):
[[DFS]] - Expand last node
[[BFS]] - Expand first node
[[Iterative Deepening Search]] - DFS with iterative limits
[[Uniform Cost Search]] - Expand nodes by lower costs

With Heuristics:
[[Greedy Search]]
[[A-star Search]]
