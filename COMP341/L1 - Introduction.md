# History
## 1940-1950 Birth Of Computation
- 1943 Logical Neuron Model
- 1950 Alan Turing Test
## 1950-1960 Birth Of Ai
- First ideas of ML
- 1956 Darthmouth Meeting, coined the term AI
- 1958 Basic Neuron Model Perceptron

## 1960-1970 Logic vs Connectionism and the First Winter
- 1965 ?
- 1969 Perceptron Book: Death of connectionism
- 1970 Backpropagation algorithm

## 1970-1990 Logic vs Connectionism and the Second Winter
- Explosion of Academic Papers and Pilot Industrial Applications
- Disappointment and the second winter
- Connectionism Rebirth: Backpropagation and advances in multi-layer neural networks (NNs)

## 1990-2005: Statistical Approaches and Machine Learning
- Probability and Uncertainty
- Support Vector Machines
- More Complicated NNs
- Reinforcement Learning
- Deepblue 1997

## 2005-onwards
- Explosion of applications
- Big Data
- Better Hardware
- Deep Learning
- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- We knew that DL would work back in 1980s 
	Didn’t know how to make it work! 
	Turns out the main bottleneck was data and faster/cheaper computation

## 2014-onwards
- Generative AI
- Creating images and text from input prompts

# Foundation Models
Foundation models, a term gaining prominence in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), refer to a class of models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data to learn a wide range of skills or capabilities. These models, once trained, can then be fine-tuned or adapted to perform specific tasks across different domains, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and beyond. The concept is largely associated with models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) from OpenAI, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) from Google, and other similar large-scale models.

# Agent
"Something that can act" –generalization of the word “individual” to non- human things
**Formally:** An autonomous entity that exists in some kind of environment and that perceives and acts.
A **rational** agent selects actions that maximize its (expected) utility
