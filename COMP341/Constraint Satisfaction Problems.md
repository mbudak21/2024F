*Formulation:*
- **Variables**: A set of variables, each with a domain of possible values.
- **Domains**: The possible values that each variable can take.
- **Constraints**: Conditions that restrict the combinations of values that variables can take.
The goal in a CSP is to assign values to all variables so that every constraint is satisfied.



1. [[Minimum Remaining Values]] + [[Degree Heuristic]] -> Pick variables
2. [[Least Constraining Value]] - Pick values
